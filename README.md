Autonomous Robot with Object Recognition and Distance Sensors Using ESP8266 and ESP32

This project showcases an autonomous robot system leveraging ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers for wireless communication, object recognition, and distance sensing. The system integrates various hardware components and software modules to achieve autonomous operation and data transmission over WiFi.

Hardware Components:
ESP8266 WiFi Module:

The ESP8266 module is used for wireless communication, enabling the robot to send and receive data over WiFi.
It's configured using SoftwareSerial for serial communication with the Arduino, facilitating control and data exchange.
ESP32 Camera Module:

The ESP32 module is equipped with a camera for object recognition tasks.
It uses a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model (ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14) for real-time object detection.
Object classes are defined in the coco.names file, providing classification capabilities for detected objects.
Sharp Distance Sensors:

The robot is equipped with Sharp distance sensors (Sharp 2Y0A21) connected to Arduino analog pins (A0-A3).
These sensors measure distances to objects in front of the robot and provide real-time feedback.
Arduino Board:

The Arduino board controls the motors, LEDs, potentiometers, and switches.
It communicates with ESP8266 and manages motor control and sensor readings.
Motor Control:

Two brushless motors from a hoverboard are controlled using PWM signals generated by the Arduino.
Motor direction and braking are controlled via dedicated pins (PWM_PIN_OUT_MOTOR1, BRAKE_PIN_MOTOR1, DIRECTION_PIN_MOTOR1, PWM_PIN_OUT_MOTOR2, BRAKE_PIN_MOTOR2, DIRECTION_PIN_MOTOR2).
LEDs, Potentiometers, and Switches:

Multiple LEDs (LED1-LED5) provide visual feedback based on sensor readings and received commands.
Potentiometers (Potentiometer_1-Potentiometer_4) adjust motor speeds or other parameters dynamically.
Switches (switch1-switch3) are used for user interaction or robot control.
Software and Communication:
Object Recognition and Detection:

The ESP32 captures images using the camera module and processes them for object detection using the SSD MobileNet model.
Detected objects are classified and visualized on the camera feed, with labels and bounding boxes indicating their positions.
Data Transmission:

The Arduino gathers sensor data from Sharp distance sensors, potentiometers, and switches.
This data is transmitted to a web server via HTTP POST requests to a PHP script (receive_data.php) hosted on https://disenomecatronicorobot1.000webhostapp.com.
Images and sensor data are encoded and sent over WiFi using the ESP8266 module.
Web Server Integration:

The web server processes incoming data, updating a database with sensor readings and object recognition results.
Data sent to the server includes distance measurements, switch states, and motor control parameters.
Responses from the server are used to control LEDs and update the robot's operational state.
Operational Flow:
Initialization:

The ESP8266 and ESP32 modules are initialized with appropriate settings and configurations.
Arduino pins are configured for motor control, sensor reading, and LED operation.
Main Loop Execution:

The main loop manages sensor readings, object detection, and motor control.
Sensor data and images are captured, processed, and transmitted to the web server.
LED states are updated based on received data from the server, indicating operational status.
Interaction and Control:

Potentiometers adjust motor speeds dynamically based on sensor inputs.
Switches enable user interaction or robot control based on their states.
The system reacts to user inputs and environmental changes, adjusting its behavior and reporting data to the server.
